Rules to find candidate numbers:
We are in a Region of Size N, filling empty spaces to a neighboring number would break that constraint -> not N in the neighbor.

We have a number >1, only one neigboring empty square -> fill with the number.

Solutions if almost full:
Square counting: If not satisfied areas add up to the missing number, everything has to come from that.


Procedure idea: 
Guess a random number to empty.
If the full field could be derived using one of the rules:
empty space.
Check if there are 2 solutions if removed
